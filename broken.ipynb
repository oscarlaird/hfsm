      "/home/oscar/cv.pdf 8 5 1.EVA is a new AI-Relational Database Management System (DBMS) for efficiently and effec-tively analysing videos and other types of unstructured data at scale. There are several researchprojects based on this system:\n",
      "/home/oscar/cv.pdf 8 6 ● EVA automatically materializes and reuses the results of expensive user-defined functions(UDFs) to facilitate faster exploratory data analysis. It differs from the state-of-the-artreuse algorithms in traditional DBMSs in three ways. First, it focuses on reusing the re-sults of UDFs as opposed to those of sub-plans. Second, it takes a symbolic approach toanalyze predicates and identify the degree of overlap between queries. Third, it factorsreuse into UDF evaluation cost and uses the updated cost function in critical query op-timization decisions like predicate reordering and model selection (results presented inSIGMOD’22).\n",
      "/home/oscar/cv.pdf 8 7 ● EVA enables automated analysis of videos at scale using computationally-intensive deeplearning models. To reduce the computational overhead of these models, it uses an ensem-ble of models that support a range of throughput-accuracy tradeoffs. Second, it adopts afine-grained approach to query optimization. It processes different chunks of the videousing different models in the given ensemble to meet the user’s accuracy requirement.Lastly, it uses a lightweight technique to prune the model ensemble to lower the queryoptimization time. We empirically show that these techniques enable EVA to outperformthe state-of-the-art video analytics systems (results presented in SIGMOD’22).\n",
      "/home/oscar/cv.pdf 8 8 ● A significant challenge that video database systems encounter lies in the drift in real-worldvisual data. For instance, a model for self-driving vehicles that is not trained on imagescontaining snow does not work well when it encounters them in practice. This drift phe-nomenon limits the accuracy of models employed for visual data analytics. EVA auto-matically detects and recovers from drift. It uses adversarial autoencoders to learn thedistribution of high-dimensional images. It leverages unsupervised algorithm for detect-ing drift by comparing the distributions of the given data against that of previously seendata. When it detects drift, it invokes a drift recovery algorithm to deploy specializedmodels tailored towards the novel data points. These specialized models outperform theirnon-specialized counterpart on accuracy, performance, and memory footprint (resultspresented in VLDB’21).\n",
      "/home/oscar/cv.pdf 8 9 ● Detection and localization of actions in videos is an important problem in practice. State-of-the-art video analytics systems are unable to efficiently and effectively answer actionqueries, because actions are often rare events, spread across a sequence of frames; detect-ing and localizing them often require computationally expensive deep neural networks. It\n",
      "/home/oscar/cv.pdf 8 10 Joy ArulrajCurriculum VitæPage 8/18\n",
      "/home/oscar/cv.pdf 9 1 is also important to consider the entire sequence of frames to effectively answer the query.EVA uses a novel technique for efficiently answering these queries using deep reinforce-ment learning. It trains a reinforcement learning agent that learns to adaptively modify theinput video segments that are subsequently sent to an action classification network. Theagent alters the input segments along three dimensions - sampling rate, segment length,and resolution. To meet the accuracy target, the query optimizer trains the agent basedon an accuracy-aware, aggregate reward function (results presented in SIGMOD’22).\n",
      "/home/oscar/cv.pdf 9 2 2.Equitas is a tool for automated verification of equivalence of SQL queries. It is based on anovel approach to determining query equivalence based on symbolic representation. The keyidea is to effectively transform a wide range of SQL queries into first order logic formulae andthen use an satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solver to efficiently verify their equivalence.\n",
      "/home/oscar/cv.pdf 9 3 3.SQLCheck is a tool for assisting database application developers by automatically detectingcommon anti-patterns in SQL queries. It leverages query and data analysis algorithms to detectanti-patterns with high precision and recall. It suggests fixes for high-impact anti-patternsusing rule-based query refactoring techniques.\n",
      "/home/oscar/cv.pdf 9 4 4.Apollo is a toolchain for automatically detecting, reporting, and diagnosing performance re-gressions in DBMSs.

The goal ofthese assignments is to familiarize the students with the internals of database management systemsand to give them immediate feedback on their solutions.The courses are based on similar programming-centric courses offered at CMU, Technische Uni-versität München, and MIT. The key difference is that as the topics are covered across two semesters(instead of one semester), the students implement the entire database system stack in the program-ming assignments. There is a significant emphasis placed on correctness and performance of thesolutions. BuzzDB leverages the Google Testing Library and the Valgrind memory error detectorto accomplish these goals.\n",
